# TRONXY-Fan-Duct

modded this design, found it on thingiverse. made a notch in the side so that i can make bigger prints, without having to worry about nailing the binfer clips on
side all the time. 

fits on my tronxy xy-2 pro, og designed for a ender3.

forgot to change file name from ender to tronxy.
